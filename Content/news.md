To our faithful Pinta'ers,

Pinta 1.1 is finally here. Although we've had many road blocks and obstacles to maneuver... we've made it!

There is still one more hurdle we need in order to make this release whole and to ensure future releases... we need more Mac OS testers.

Due to not enough testers we've decided to leave Pinta for Mac OS X at v1.0 with the 1.1 BETA available for use and testing.

So please, if you have access to Mac OS X and would like to test the latest cutting edge version of Pinta for yourself and the community, please head on over to the [Google Group][4] and get involved.

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this release and that continue to support this awesome project.

With fall flying by and winter looming, we hope that you all have a fun and safe time with friends and family.

To our faithful Pinta'ers,

Pinta is Alive and Well, a new community has formed to take up the work of Pinta founder, Jonathan Pobst.

As informed in the OMG! Ubuntu! September 6th, 2011 article, development did cease, [read it here][5], but only for a short time!

With the well wishes of its founder, Pinta's new community is gaining strength quickly.

For now, we will continue to use the [Google Group][4] for community input and reports and the website for overall web presence. We are also working on a [Launchpad][6] development team and a [Git Hub][7] repo for easy distribution. We are also expanding to Facebook with our new [Page][8] and [Group][9].

The new community is very thankful for this great project that Jonathan Pobst has started and completed to version 1.0. With that, we are going to continue to grow the community, fix bugs, improve performance, and scalability with the assistance of Jonathan Pobst. For anyone who would like to assist, please join the [Google mailing list][4] and request it.

In the near future we will be delivering a new release with several bug fixes. This release will include fixes for the following:
* #792732 and #671449: Add open images pad
* #846755: Make the Save As action work properly
* #689525: Store last saved/opened path in settings
* #776307: Prevent creation of images with width 0px or height 0px
* #730798: Preserve zoom setting after undo
* #797140: more zoom option

With the following still being worked on:
* #730098: Selection resizing

We're extremely excited to continue the awesome work that Jonathan has started and to expand Pinta to the highest limits possible.

So strap in, things are only just now revving up, and prepare for an awesome ride!
